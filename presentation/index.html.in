# Type Erasure
## Solving Classic OOP Problems with an Elegant Design Pattern
### Zach Laine

====================

## Outline
- The Importance of Values
- Why Polymorphism?
- Those Other Solutions
- Type Erasure

----

## A Quick Aside

All the code you will see in this presentation compiles and works as
advertized.

====================

# Part 1
## The Importance of Values

----

Dealing with values instead of references has a couple of very nice benefits

- Clear ownership/lifetime semantics
- Equational reasoning

----

## Clear Semantics

Who owns `foo`?

%%pointer_factory_1%%

Is this better?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

%%shared_pointer_factory%%
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

That depends on whether you're partial to global state....
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

----

## Equational Reasoning

%%pointer_factory_2%%

With value types, you only have to reason about the values in the code front
of you.

With reference types, you must **simultaneously** reason about code that
mutates the values elsewhere.

====================

# Part 2
## Why Polymorphism?

### Code reuse of course!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

----

Q: How does the author of this function intend its users to use it?

%%nonpolymorphic_predicate%%

A: Non-polymorphically.  You have to give me a <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->`some_t` object, or get sliced.
Not terribly reusable with other types.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

----

Q: How about this one?

%%runtime_polymorphic_predicate%%

A: Runtime-polymorphically.  You can give me any <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
`base_t`-derived object by
reference.  The function is now more reusable, but you must use inheritance.
Yuck!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

----

Q: Or this?

%%compile_time_polymorphic_predicate%%

A: Compile-time-polymorphically.  You can give me any object whose type can be
used to instantiated the template.  The function is now even more reusable,
but you must use metaprogramming. Gross!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

----

Q: Is this an example of polymorphism?

%%example_of_polymorphism%%

A: No!  Polymorphism means using one type as if it were another type.  Here,
we have to cast to make the type we have look like the type expected in the
interface to <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->`foo()`.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

====================

# Part 3
## Those Other Solutions

- Inheritance-Based Runtime polymorphism
- Template-based Compile-time polymorphism

====================

## (Problems with) Inheritance as Runtime Polymorphism

----

The inheritance mechanism gives us polymorphism, but we must either:

- Limit ourselves to a single interface found in the base class:

%%single_base_class_interface%%

----

Note that the "base" could use multiple inheritance, as long as the symbols in
all the multiply inherited bases do not collide.

----

*OR*

----

- Use multiple inheritance to bolt on multiple interfaces:

%%multiple_inheritance_below_base%%

Which leads to the "diamond of death",
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

which leads to virtual inheritance,
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

which leads to fear,
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

which leads to anger,
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4"-->

... you get it.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

More importantly, we have actually given up polymorphism by doing this; we
must carry around the information that <!-- .element: class="fragment"
data-fragment-index="6" --> `b_pointer` contains interfaces not found in
`base`.


----

We cannot make classes from different class hierarchies conform to a common
interface, because they have no common base to use when passing them.

%%different_heirarchies_1%%

Note that `int_foo` and `float_foo` both have a member

`void log() const`.

----

So, we ditch code reuse in the case of logging:

%%different_heirarchies_2%%

Or we resort to ugly hacks:

%%different_heirarchies_3%%

----

We cannot easily separate interface and implementation without using multiple
inheritance.

----

Virtual functions can be tricky to get right, especially in large class
heirarchies.

- We've all seen lots of these problems in real code.
- C++11's `override` and `final` help.
- There is frequently a question of whether or not a given type's virtual
  function implementation should call its base class's version of the same
  function.

----

In addition to all the above limitations, we are limited in which interfaces
we give to which types by our choice of base class(es).

Inheritance imposes very tight coupling; it is not possible to have unrelated
types with the same interfaces used interchangably.

----

We must always take parameters by reference to use runtime polymorphism.
There go our nice benefits from value semantics.

----

### A Quick Case Study: Widgets and Layouts

Widgets are UI elements (buttons, text boxes, etc.).
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Layouts place widgets in the UI.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

A layout can contain widgets.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

A layout can contain sublayouts.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Using inheritance, you are all but locked in to giving layouts and widgets a
common base,
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

... even though that makes no sense.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

====================

## (Problems with) Templates as Compile-time Polymorphism

----

### The Classic Problems

- Metaprogramming requires a large body of knowledge about a large number of
  obscure language rules, and even more obscure TMP-specific tricks.

- Metaprogramming heavy code is hard to maintain.  This is true for experts,
  but is moreso in a team of varying skill levels.

- Metaprogramming might be simply impossible to use where you work (even if
  you wanted to).

- Compile times and object code size can get away from you if you're not
  careful.

----

Does not play well with runtime variation.

Compile-time is easy:

%%compile_time_return_type%%

Runtime is impossible (without type erasure):

```cpp
template <typename TrueType, typename FalseType>
auto factory_function (bool selection) -> /* ??? */
{ return /* ??? */; }
```

----

Because of the lack of easy runtime interoperability, once you decide to use
TMP, you're almost always stuck doing more TMP.

====================

## There **must** be a better way!

![](presentation/there_must_be_a_better_way.gif)

====================

# Part 4
## Type Erasure

----

Based on everything we've seen so far, we want an interface that works like
this:

%%wanted_interface%%

----

### Making magic happen

%%anything_declaration%%

----

`anything` definitions

%%anything_definitions%%

----

`anything::handle` definitions

%%anything_handle_definitions%%

----

`anything` in action

%%anything_in_action%%

Dymamic typing ("duck typing"), similar to that in Python.  Consider dumping
scripting languages for this.

That's not a joke.

----

Q: Can `anything` really hold anything?

A: No, but it can hold anything with a copy constructor.  It should really be
called <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->`copyable`.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

----

Ok, so how do we get back to this?

%%wanted_interface%%

----

Easy -- just forward the calls to `value()`:

%%value_forwarded_1%%

%%value_forwarded_2%%

%%value_forwarded_3%%

----

We can add any arbitrary API in the same fashion.  It's easy but repetitive to
do so.  More on that in a bit.

----

Say we have two disjoint APIs we wish to support.

One erased type for all widgets:

%%widget_api%%

And one for all objects that can be used in our layout system:

%%layoutable_api%%

----

Here it is in use:

%%disjoint_apis_in_use%%

----

Q: What about performance?

A: It's complicated.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

----

### Pointer-based Inheritance vs. Erased Types

Function call overhead is exactly the same.

How about heap allocations?

| Operation               | Inheritance | Simple Type Erasure |
| ----------------------- |:-----------:|:-------------------:|
| Construct               | Yes         | Yes                 |
| Copy                    | No          | Yes                 |
| Assign                  | No          | Yes                 |
| Get Alternate Interface | No*         | Yes                 |

\* `dynamic_cast<>` is not free, and is not consistent with polymorphism.

This chart also applies to copies of the underlying object.

====================

## Optimizing the Type Erasure Technique

----

### Step 1: Accept references

Instead of always copying the given value, accept `std::reference_wrapper`s.

%%type_erasure_plus_ref_wrapper%%

----

Replace the `handle` constructor with these:

%%handle_ref_wrapper_ctors%%

----

Add this specialization:

%%ref_wrapper_specialization%%

----

### Pointer-based Inheritance vs. Erased Types

Allocations did not change.

How about copies of the underlying object?

| Operation      | Inh. | Simple TE | TE + ref  |
| -------------- |:----:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Construct      | Yes  | Yes       | No        |
| Copy           | No   | Yes       | No        |
| Assign         | No   | Yes       | No        |
| Alt. Interface | No*  | Yes       | No        |

All versions discussed hereafter include support for `std::reference_wrapper`.

----

### Step 2: Use a Copy-On-Write Wrapper

Instead of always copying our type erased objects, only copy them when they
are mutated.

%%type_erasure_plus_cow_wrapper_usage%%

A nice benefit of using copy-on-write is thread safety.

----

### Pointer-based Inheritance vs. Erased Types

Allocations:

| Operation      | Inh. | Simple TE | TE + COW  |
| -------------- |:----:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Construct      | 1    | 1         | 2         |
| Copy           | 0    | 1         | 0         |
| Assign         | 0    | 1         | 0         |
| Alt. Interface | 0*   | 1         | 2         |

----

### Step 3: Integrate Copy-On-Write into Erased Types

Remove one set of allocations on construction by applying copy-on-write
directly to the `handle_` member.

%%type_erasure_with_cow%%

Copies only happen when a non-const member function is called.

----

### Pointer-based Inheritance vs. Erased Types

Allocations:

| Operation      | Inh. | Simple TE | TE w/COW  |
| -------------- |:----:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Construct      | 1    | 1         | 1         |
| Copy           | 0    | 1         | 0         |
| Assign         | 0    | 1         | 0         |
| Alt. Interface | 0*   | 1         | 1         |

----

### Step 4: Apply the Small Buffer Optimization

%%type_erasure_with_sbo%%

----

### Pointer-based Inheritance vs. Erased Types

Allocations for small<sup>&dagger;</sup>/large objects:

| Operation      | Inh. | Simple TE | TE w/SBO  |
| -------------- |:----:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Construct      | 1/1  | 1/1       | 0/1       |
| Copy           | 0/0  | 1/1       | 0/1       |
| Assign         | 0/0  | 1/1       | 0/1       |
| Alt. Interface | 0/0* | 1/1       | 0/1       |

<sup>&dagger;</sup> `std::referece_wrapper` is always small.

----

### Step 5: Apply SBO and Integrated COW

%%type_erasure_with_sbo_and_cow%%

----

### Pointer-based Inheritance vs. Erased Types

Allocations for small<sup>&dagger;</sup>/large objects:

| Operation      | Inh. | Simple TE | TE w/SBO+COW|
| -------------- |:----:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Construct      | 1/1  | 1/1       | 0/1         |
| Copy           | 0/0  | 1/1       | 0/0         |
| Assign         | 0/0  | 1/1       | 0/0         |
| Alt. Interface | 0/0* | 1/1       | 0/1         |

<sup>&dagger;</sup> Again, `std::referece_wrapper` is always small.

Copies only happen when a non-const member function is called.

----

The final implementation is a bit long to show here.

====================

## A Quick Review

What have we gained versus using inheritance?

What have we lost?

----

### Gains

- Value semantics

- Never writing `new` or `delete`

- Ability to bind types to interfaces never seen at the time of the types'
  writing, including multiple interfaces

- Thread safety via copy-on-write

- Elision of heap allocations for small types and references

----

### Losses

- Simplicity of implementation

- Thread safety come at the cost of some atomic operations and copies when
  values are mutated

====================

## Another Option: Boost.TypeErasure

Boost.TypeErasure is the most robust library-based type erasure solution to
date.

- Uses metapgrogramming-based explicit v-table construction.
- Supports casts directly to the held type, &agrave; la Boost.Any.
- Supports free-function requirements.
- Supports operator requirements.
- Supports associated type requirements.
- Supports concept maps.

----

An example from the online docs:

```cpp
any<
    mpl::vector<
        copy_constructible<>,
        typeid_<>,
        incrementable<>,
        ostreamable<>
    >
> x(10);
++x;
std::cout << x << std::endl; // prints 11
```

----

An example of an erased type with a member function:

```cpp
BOOST_TYPE_ERASURE_MEMBER((has_push_back), push_back, 1)

void append_many(any<has_push_back<void(int)>, _self&> container) {
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        container.push_back(i);
}
```

----

### Caveats

- The per-object v-table can create large objects.
- All the metaprogramming can contribute to long compile times.
- The error messages will make your eyes bleed.
- The small buffer optimization is not supported. 
- Writing `const` member function requirements is not straightforward.

====================

## Inheritance vs. Hand-Rolled Type Erasure vs. Boost.TypeErasure

----

Allocations for small/large/ref held values:

| Operation      | Inh.  | Optimized TE | Boost TE |
| -------------- |:-----:|:------------:|:--------:|
| Construct      | 1/1/- | 0/1/0        | 1/1/0    |
| Copy           | 0/0/- | 0/0/0        | 1/1/0    |
| Assign         | 0/0/- | 0/0/0        | 1/1/0    |
| Alt. Interface | 0/0/-*| 0/1/0        | 1/1/0    |

All values are the same for copies of the underlying value, except for the
optimized hand-rolled version's binding to an alternate interface.

----

Space requirements, including held-object storage:

| Technique      | Held Object Size   | Space Requirement  |
| -------------- |:------------------:|:------------------:|
| Inheritance    | All                | `P` + `O`          |
| Hand-rolled TE | Small              | `P` + `B`          |
| Hand-rolled TE | Large              | `P` + `B` + `O`    |
| Boost TE       | All                | `FM` + `O`         |

`P` is the size of a pointer to a heap-allocated object, `F` is the size of a
pointer-to-function, `O` is the size of the stored object, `M` is the number
of members in an erased type's interface, and `B` is small buffer size.

====================

## One More Thing ...

The biggest advantage of using Boost.TypeErasure over a hand-rolled
implementation is that your hands get a rest.

Q: How do we avoid large amounts of cut-and-pasted code?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

A: We generate it, using <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->`emtypen`.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

----

## `emtypen`

`emtypen` is an MIT-licensed tool that takes a real C++ header with one or
more archetypal interfaces and produces the hand-rolled version of the type
erasure techniques presented in this talk.  It uses libclang. For example:

```cpp
$ emtypen archetypes.hpp > generated.hpp
```

`generated.hpp` now contains the generated erased types, one for each
archetypal `struct`/`class` in `archetypes.hpp`.

All the erased types in the code in this talk were generated using this tool.

----

Your input can be a real-boy C++ header, that you can syntax check with a real
compiler.

As for the output,

- Include guards are preserved.
- Included headers are preserved.
- Namespaces are preserved.
- All `struct`/`class` definitions are converted to erased types.
- Templated archetypes are supported.
- Everything else is lost (including macros and comments, because libclang).

----

Archetype input:

%%loggable_archetype%%

----

Erased type output:

%%loggable_erased_type%%

----

`emtypen` generates your erased types based on a "form" file.

The form file contains the boilerplate code for generating one erased type.

`emtypen` takes optional command-line parameters that can be used to change
the form file used, or the block of headers it includes near the top of the
file.

You can completely change the boilerplate if you like.  Forms are provided for
all the hand-rolled versions of type erasure presented in this talk.
